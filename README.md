# Arms-Race
Improving the Richardson Arms Race model by leveraging a carrying capacity for the nuclear arsenal combined with a more nuanced approach to handling grievances to decisively converge to stable points with minimized over/under reactions. This more accurately captures the rapid escalations and de-escalations found in real-world arms races.
